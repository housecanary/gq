// Package ast provides an AST of a GraphQL query or schema.
//
// This package's API is UNSTABLE.  New members may be added at
// any time, or renamed/moved.
//
// Design notes: this package should consist of simple structs, and perhaps
// some marshaling code.  No business logic, should just be storage of a parsed
// document
